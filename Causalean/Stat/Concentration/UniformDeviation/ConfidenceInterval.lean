# Finite-sample confidence intervals from concentration tails

Inverting the two-sided Hoeffding and (oracle) Bernstein tail bounds of
`Causalean.Stat.Concentration` into *finite-sample* confidence half-widths.  Given a
confidence parameter `δ ∈ (0, 1]`, each result produces an explicit half-width
`w(n, δ)` and proves the **miss-probability guarantee**

    P( w ≤ |X̄ₙ − m| ) ≤ δ,

i.e. with probability at least `1 − δ` the population mean `m = ∫ f ∂P` lies in
the random interval `[X̄ₙ − w, X̄ₙ + w]`.  This is the finite-sample analogue of
the asymptotic Wald interval (`Stat/Inference/`); unlike the latter it holds at
every fixed `n`, not only in the limit.

## Contents

* `hoeffdingCIHalfWidth a b n δ = (b − a) · √(log(2/δ) / (2n))` — the Hoeffding
  half-width, valid for any `[a,b]`-valued statistic.
* `hoeffding_ci_miss` — `P(w ≤ |X̄ₙ − m|) ≤ δ`, by inverting `hoeffding_abs_ge`.
* `hoeffding_ci_cover` — coverage complement: `1 − δ ≤ P(|X̄ₙ − m| < w)`.
* `bernsteinCIHalfWidth c σ n δ = 2σ·√(log(2/δ)/n) + 2c·(log(2/δ)/n)` — the
  variance-adaptive Bernstein half-width.  When the variance proxy `σ²` is small
  this is much tighter than Hoeffding's `O((b−a)/√n)`: its leading term is
  `2σ√(log(2/δ)/n)` with a fast `O(1/n)` correction.
* `bernstein_ci_miss` — `P(w ≤ |X̄ₙ − m|) ≤ δ`, by inverting `bernstein_abs_ge`.
* `bernstein_ci_cover` — coverage complement: `1 − δ ≤ P(|X̄ₙ − m| < w)`.

The Bernstein exponent inversion is exact up to a nonnegative slack: writing
`L = log(2/δ)` and `s = √(L/n)`, the chosen half-width satisfies
`n·w² − 2Lc·w − 4Lσ² = 4nσc·s³ ≥ 0`, which is precisely the quadratic
condition making the tail `≤ δ`.

/-! # Concentration confidence intervals

This file inverts the two-sided Hoeffding and Bernstein sample-mean tail
bounds into explicit finite-sample confidence intervals. It defines
`hoeffdingCIHalfWidth` and `bernsteinCIHalfWidth`, proves miss-probability
forms `hoeffding_ci_miss` and `bernstein_ci_miss`, and proves the corresponding
coverage forms `hoeffding_ci_cover` and `bernstein_ci_cover`.
