# DCDH residualized treatment as a derived FWL residual

`FinitePanel.lean` takes the residualized treatment `D̃` as a *primitive
orthogonality witness*: it merely posits the membership `D − D̃ ∈ H_GT`, the
orthogonality `∑ π D̃ h = 0`, and positivity `S_D > 0`.  The paper, however,
*derives* `D̃` as the Frisch–Waugh–Lovell residual of the treatment projected on
the two-way fixed-effect span — i.e. the double-demeaned treatment `D̈`.

This file verifies, for the uniform balanced panel, that the DCDH residualized
treatment can be constructed from the usual two-way fixed-effect residual. It
builds a genuine `DCDHPanel` whose `Dtilde` is the double-demeaned treatment
`UniformTwoWayPanel.ddot D`, with the membership and orthogonality fields
*proved* from `UniformTwoWayPanel` (`sub_ddot_eq_unitTimeProjection`,
`unitTimeProjection_additive`, `ddot_orthogonal_unit_time`) rather than assumed.

Only `S_D > 0` (nonzero double-demeaned treatment variation — the genuine
identification input that the treatment is not collinear with the FE span) and
the binary-treatment / consistency primitives remain as hypotheses, exactly as
in the source.  No measure theory is used: the construction is pure uniform
finite-panel algebra.

Builds a genuine `DCDHPanel` for the uniform balanced panel in which the
residualized treatment is the double-demeaned treatment `D̈ = ddot D`.  The
`D_minus_resid_mem` and `Dtilde_orthogonal` fields are *derived* from the
double-demeaning algebra in `UniformTwoWayPanel`, not posited.  The remaining
hypotheses (`hD_binary`, `hconsistency`, `hSD`) are the source's genuine
primitives: binary treatment, the consistency identity, and nonzero
double-demeaned treatment variation. -/
