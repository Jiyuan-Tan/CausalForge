# Weighted support: a finite weighted-index probability object

This file formalizes the **substrate** of the FWL/WLS algebra used across
Causalean's identification and estimand-characterization layer: a finite index
set `R` (the *support*) together with strictly positive weights `ω_r` summing
to 1 over the observed subset.

This substrate is the algebraic foundation for Frisch-Waugh-Lovell: its
weighted projections (`Causalean/Panel/Weighted/Subspace.lean`) are the
solutions of the weighted-least-squares problem
(`Causalean/Panel/Weighted/WLS.lean`). Estimand-characterization arguments read
off implicit regression weights from `fwl_identity`
(`Causalean/Panel/Weighted/FWL.lean`).

This generalizes the panel-specific `Causalean/Panel/Cells.lean`, which now
becomes a thin abbreviation `Cells I T := WeightedSupport (I × T)`.

Mirrors Definition 2.1 of
`CausalSmith/doc/general_projection_carryover_note.tex`.

## Main definitions

* `WeightedSupport R` — a structure carrying the observed-index set, the
  weight function, and the positivity / normalization axioms.

/-! # Weighted finite supports

This file defines `WeightedSupport`, a finite observed support equipped with
strictly positive weights that sum to one on the observed set and vanish off it.
It also proves the basic normalization lemmas `weight_nonneg`,
`sum_weight_univ`, `sum_weight`, and `sum_weight_univ_eq_one`.

The resulting object is the common finite weighted-index substrate for weighted
inner products, weighted least squares, and Frisch-Waugh-Lovell decompositions. -/

/-- A finite weighted index together with positive normalized weights:
[a nonempty observed subset of indices](hyp:observed,observed_nonempty) together with
[a weight function](hyp:weight) that is [strictly positive on every observed
index](hyp:weight_pos), [vanishes off the observed set](hyp:weight_zero_off), and
[sums to one over the observed indices](hyp:weight_sum_one).

The pair `(observed, weight)` records:

* `observed : Finset R` — the observed subset of indices, required nonempty;
* `weight : R → ℝ` — a (total) weight function that is strictly positive
  on `observed`, vanishes off `observed`, and sums to 1 over `observed`.
